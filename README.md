# GdxGame

## Description

<p>This project is based on https://carelesslabs.wordpress.com/2017/07/30/making-a-libgdx-roguelike-survival-game-part-1-gamedev/
using LibGDX library.<br>
It is a roguelike RPG 2D base game.</p>

#### Map
<p>The map is actually a random quadrilateral island area with random trees.</p>

#### Entities
<p>For the moment, there is only a hero that can move inside the island with the direction pad or with "WASD". <br>
The hero is only a png image. It will become, soon, an animated 2D sprite.</p>
